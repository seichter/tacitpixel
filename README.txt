TacitPixel
----------

TacitPixel is a prototyping tool and framework for building scenegraphs. It is no feature complete
but does demonstrate a number of things that are somewhat helpful.

TacitPixel started its life in 1999 when there were not many scenegraphs and programming libraries available. 
I started to write it to support my studies and to quickly prototype tools for architectural design. That's 
where the original "The Architectural Playground" libTAP name came from and also the tpXYZ naming scheme. 
You might also stumble upon the software as TwistedPair when I worked at the HIT Lab NZ. It was probably one
of the first real OpenGL based scenegraphs on Windows Mobile 5.

But for quite some time I use the term tacit pixel for it. 


Dependencies
------------

TacitPixel comes with batteries included. Hence there are a number of libraries that I have choosen
purely from the viewpoint of being small (work on embedded systems), fast and flexible.
