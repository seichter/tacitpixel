TacitPixel
----------

TacitPixel started its life in 1999 when there were not many scenegraphs and programming libraries available. It originally appeared as "The Architectural Playground", hence the tpXYZ naming scheme. You might also stumble upon it as TwistedPair in some relation to my work at HIT Lab NZ. But for quite some time I use the term tacit pixel for it.
